# Project Description:

The purpose of this dashboard is to provide insights into natural disasters, including climatological,
geophysical, hydrological, and meteorological events. It is designed to serve a dual purpose: to raise
awareness among the general public about the impact of these disasters and to equip decision-
makers with valuable information for proactive measures. By analyzing data on the number of
people affected or deceased in each country over specific decades, this dashboard aims to foster
informed decision-making and facilitate the formulation of effective disaster response strategies.
Natural disasters have a profound impact on communities worldwide. These unpredictable
occurrences demand effective planning and response strategies to mitigate their effects. Our group
project focuses on developing an interactive dashboard that consolidates and visualizes data about
natural disasters encompassing occurrence patterns, affected populations, and greenhouse
emissions. Through this dashboard, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of environmental
challenges, allowing for informed decision-making and proactive measures towards disaster
resilience and sustainability.

In designing our dashboard, we have adhered to key principles learned in class, ensuring clarity,
accessibility, and user-friendliness. We have paid special attention to potential design pitfalls such as
misleading labels, inadequate contrast, and considerations for color blindness to enhance the
dashboard's effectiveness.
Our design assures that the dashboard is intuitive and easy for the intended audience to understand.
